He then takes the 2 commodities from the top of the two stacks around him.
9 please see the illustration. (FIG.3)

Tactically, he keeps 1 for himself and puts 1 in the Bank. He ﬁnishes his turn
by updating the Commodity Price Board. To do so, he moves the token for
the commodity he has sold down by one notch. This reduces its value by the
same amount. Its price cannot increase.

Game end:

The game is over when there are only 2 stacks left in the game.(FIG.4)

You should then add up your points. Each player calculates the Value of his
commodities according to the trading price shown on the ﬁnal board.

The player with the most points is the winner!

"Expert" version:

Instead of moving the Trader forward by 1, 2 or 3 stacks, you can move him
by as many stacks as you wish, in a clockwise direction, up to a square
displaying the same commodity as the one shown on the square he just left, ‘
without going beyond it. If the next square contains the same commodity,

in this case he will only move by a single square. If it's behind him, he may
possibly go all the way around.
